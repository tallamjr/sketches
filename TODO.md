# Sketches: High-Performance Probabilistic Data Structures

The `sketches` repo is to be a high-performant implementation of various
probabilistic data structures.

In terms of features it should implement as part of its library all those
outlined here: https://github.com/gakhov/pdsa

Furthermore, it would be great if it also ensure to implement those found here:
https://github.com/apache/datasketches-postgresql/blob/master/README.md

In terms of the repository layout, I have moved towards preferring the structure
found at ../evlib better where we have a single crate that has all functionality
implemented in src and the bindings defined in lib.rs. Like evlib there should
be an examples folder that is able to showcase the functionality and notebooks
users can play with.

All implementation should be verified with `cargo check` and `cargo test` as well as
`pytest` for python code and `pytest --nbmake` to verify notebooks.

Please refer to the @TODO.md file to develop a plan for implementing the
features described therein. You should think hard about what a roadmap should
look like and then when that is in place you should update the TODO.md with an
outline of this plan.

When you are ready to tackle this please go ahead and begin the restructuring of
the codebase and implementation of the functionality. You should commit your
changes often and make sure a good message is given.

Where possible all implementation should leverage SIMD and if at all possible
have an option to leverage GPU acceleration via CUDA or ideally Metal for macOS.
