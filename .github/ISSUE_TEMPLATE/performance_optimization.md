## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Goal
Brief description of the performance improvement target.

## ðŸ“Š Current Performance
- **Metric**: [throughput/memory/latency]
- **Current Value**: [measurement]
- **Target Value**: [target]
- **Gap**: [current gap vs target]

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach
Detail the technical implementation approach.

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Impact
- **Performance Improvement**: [percentage or multiplier]
- **Memory Impact**: [increase/decrease]
- **Complexity**: [low/medium/high]

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
